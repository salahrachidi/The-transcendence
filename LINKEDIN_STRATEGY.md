## Introduction: The "Psychology" of Recruitment
Recruiters scan profiles for specific signals. Your goal isn't just to say "I built an app." It's to say "I solve hard problems."

**Key Factors We Are Leveraging:**
1.  **Curiosity (The Hook):** Making them want to click "See More".
2.  **Competence (The Stack):** Showing, not just telling, that you know modern tools (Vault, Docker).
3.  **Communication (The Story):** Engineers who can write are rare. Good writing = Good communication skills.

### Option 1: The "Hero's Journey" (Focus: Problem Solving)
*Best for: Showing resilience and engineering depth.*

**Headline/Hook:**
"I thought storing secrets in `.env` was fine. Then I learned about HashiCorp Vault."

**Body:**
When building **ft_transcendence**, a real-time analytics platform, I faced a choice: Do I do what's easy, or do I do what's *right*?

Most student projects are simple. But production isn't simple. I wanted to simulate a real enterprise environment.
So, I integrated **HashiCorp Vault** into my Dockerized Next.js & Fastify stack.

It wasn't easy. I spent days debugging the "Secret Zero" problem and handling secure token rotation. But the result? A platform that doesn't just play Pong—it manages sensitive data with bank-grade security standards.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, Fastify, Docker, Vault, PostgreSQL.

### Option 2: The "Tech Flex" (Focus: Modern Stack)
*Best for: Attracting startups and modern tech companies.*

**Headline/Hook:**
"Why I chose Fastify over Express for my latest high-performance project."

**Body:**
Latency kills engagement. For **ft_transcendence**, a real-time multiplayer gaming platform, every millisecond counts.

That's why I architected the backend with **Fastify**.
Combined with a **Next.js 15** frontend and a fully containerized **Docker** environment, the performance gains were immediate.

But speed implies risk. To balance this, I implemented an **Nginx WAF** (Web Application Firewall) and **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets.

It's not just a game; it's a snippet of a high-scale infrastructure.

### Option 3: The "Visual Tease" (Focus: UI/UX)
*Best for: Frontend roles and general engagement.*

**Headline/Hook:**
"Real-time data doesn't have to look boring. 🎨"

**Body:**
(Attach the Gameplay or Dashboard GIF here)

I spent the last few weeks polishing the UI for **ft_transcendence**.
The Challenge: Rendering real-time WebSocket updates (60fps) without crashing the React render cycle.

The Solution: Optimistic UI updates and efficient state management in **Next.js**.

The result is butter-smooth gameplay and live analytics that update instantly.
Data is beautiful when it moves.
