# Visual Assets Guide 📸

Recruiters spend about **6 seconds** scanning a resume/portfolio. Text is invisible to them. Images are sticky.
You need to generate the following assets to make your README and LinkedIn posts "pop".

## 🛠️ Tools to Use
- **QuickTime Player (Mac):** great for screen recording.
- **Ezgif.com:** To convert videos to optimized GIFs.
- **CleanShot X (Optional):** If you have it, it's the best.

## 📋 The Shot List

### 1. The "Gameplay" GIF (Priority: HIGH)
*Goal: Prove it's a real, working video game.*
- **Action:** Start a match. Record about 5-10 seconds of hitting the ball back and forth.
- **Look for:** Smooth movement, score updating.
- **Filename:** `gameplay.gif`

### 2. The "Dashboard" GIF (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Goal: Show data visualization skills.*
- **Action:** Navigate to the dashboard. Hover over the charts. Show the tooltips appearing.
- **Look for:** Nice hover effects, data loading.
- **Filename:** `dashboard-stats.gif`

### 3. The "Security/Login" Flow (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Goal: Prove the auth/security depth.*
- **Action:** Record the login screen -> Input 2FA code -> Redirect to Home.
- **Look for:** The smooth transition and the "Success" toast notification.
- **Filename:** `auth-flow.gif`

### 4. The "Architecture" Screenshot (Priority: LOW)
*Goal: Immediate technical context.*
- **Action:** If you have a nice diagram tool (or use the Mermaid one in README), take a clean screenshot of the system design.
- **Filename:** `architecture_diagram.png`

### 5. The "Transcendence" Cover Art (Bonus)
*Goal: Mind-blowing visual hook.*
- **Action:** Use the AI-generated image created for you (Deity with Tech Stack arms).
- **Use case:** LinkedIn Banner or README Header.
- **Filename:** `transcendence_project_art.png`

## 💡 How to Add to README
Once you have these files:
1. Upload them to a folder named `assets/` in your repo (or just drag-and-drop them into a GitHub issue to get a hosted URL).
2. Update the `README.md` image links:
   `![Gameplay](link_to_your_gif.gif)`
